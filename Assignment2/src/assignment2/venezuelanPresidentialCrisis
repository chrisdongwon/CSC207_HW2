A nationwide crisis concerning who is the legitimate President of Venezuela has been underway since 10 January 2019, when the opposition-majority National Assembly declared that incumbent Nicolás Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid and the body elevated its leader, Juan Guaidó, as acting president.

The process and results of the presidential election of 20 May 2018 had been widely disputed.[1] The National Assembly declared Maduro illegitimate on the day of his second inauguration, citing the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution enacted under Hugo Chávez, Maduro's predecessor; in response, the pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal of Justice said the National Assembly's declaration was unconstitutional.[2]

Mass protests throughout Venezuela and the world occurred on 23 January when Guaidó called for Venezuelans to demonstrate against Maduro.[3][4] Demonstrations in support of the Bolivarian Revolution and government took place as well.[5]

Special meetings in the Organization of American States (OAS) on 24 January and in the United Nations (UN) on 26 January were held but no consensus was reached. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for dialogue.[6] Mexico and Uruguay announced an international conference for countries with a neutral position to take place in Montevideo on 7 February.[7]

Maduro's government says the current crisis is a coup d'état led by the United States to topple him and control the country's oil reserves.

Since 2010, Venezuela has been suffering a socioeconomic crisis under Nicolás Maduro (and briefly under his predecessor, Hugo Chávez), as rampant crime, hyperinflation and shortages diminish the quality of life.[11][12][13][14][15][16] As a result of discontent with the government, the opposition was elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 parliamentary election.[17] After the election, the lame duck National Assembly—consisting of Bolivarian officials—filled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the highest court in Venezuela, with Maduro allies.[17][18] The tribunal stripped three opposition lawmakers of their National Assembly seats in early 2016, citing alleged "irregularities" in their elections, thereby preventing an opposition supermajority which would have been able to challenge President Maduro.[17]

The tribunal then approved several actions by Maduro and granted him more powers in 2017.[17] As protests mounted against Maduro, he called for a constituent assembly that would draft a new constitution to replace the 1999 Venezuela Constitution created under Chávez.[19] Many countries considered these actions a bid by Maduro to stay in power indefinitely,[20] and over 40 countries stated that they would not recognize the National Constituent Assembly.[21][22] The Democratic Unity Roundtable—the opposition to the incumbent ruling party—boycotted the election, saying that the Constituent Assembly was "a trick to keep [the incumbent ruling party] in power".[23] Since the opposition did not participate in the election, the incumbent Great Patriotic Pole, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, won almost all seats in the assembly by default.[24][25][26] On 8 August 2017, the Constituent Assembly declared itself to be the government branch with supreme power in Venezuela, banning the opposition-led National Assembly from performing actions that would interfere with the assembly while continuing to pass measures in "support and solidarity" with President Maduro, effectively stripping the National Assembly of all its powers.
In February 2018, Maduro called for presidential elections four months before the prescribed date.[28] He was declared the winner in May 2018 after multiple major opposition parties were banned from participating, and other irregularities; many said the elections were invalid.[29][30][31][32] Paired with views of Maduro's leadership being an ineffective dictatorship,[33][34][35] politicians both internally and internationally said Maduro was not legitimately elected.[36] In the months leading up to his 10 January 2019 inauguration, Maduro was pressured to step down by nations and bodies including the Lima Group (excluding Mexico), the United States, and the OAS, with this pressure being increased as the new National Assembly of Venezuela was sworn in on 5 January 2019.[37][38][39] Maduro disavowed the National Assembly in 2017;[40] as of 2018, the National Assembly was the only democratically elected institution left in the country,[a] and human rights organizations said there were no independent institutional checks on presidential power.[b]
